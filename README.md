# Lab 3: More C programming

In this lab, you'll get a little more practice writing programs in C using loops and conditionals. 

## Deliverable 

To get credit for this lab, you must demonstrate at least 50% effort. That could mean you've gotten at least half of each problem done, or that you've completely done half of the problems. My advice: Aim to complete all of them, but just don't stress too much about it if you don't finish everything. How annoying would it be to be close to 50% effort and just not quite over the line? If you come back to it a couple times throughout the week, every time you are done working, just update your files in this repository. You can do this just by uploading the file from your computer to the repository again with the "Add file" button -- it will automatically replace the existing file with the new one.

## Read from a file and calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle

Write a program to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the formula $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ for $a, b$ two sides of the right triangle and $c$ the hypotenuse. Your program should take in the values for $a$ and $b$ from a file called `input.txt`. Use the example code in `read_from_file.c` and `input.txt` to get started.
